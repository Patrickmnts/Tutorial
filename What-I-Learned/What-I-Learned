In the rails tutorial that "RailsGirls" were so nice to set up, I had the opportunity to
learn far more than simply following the steps, and playing copy cat. Here is a fun list
set up in HTML style, just so I can keep practicing away!

The Things I Learned:
	<ul>
		<ls> Comfort with and around the command line, it is not as scary as it looks! </ls>
		<ls> How to open folders from the command line into my text editor. </ls>
		<ls> What "LocalHost" is and how to use it, as well as trouble shooting. It works
				much better when you push the changes to the server instead of just wondering
				why the refresh button isn't working. </ls>
		<ls> A real example of the differences between strings, arrays and objects.  I know
				in ruby "everything is an object". </ls>
		<ls> How to upload a project of my own to Github. It took a minute to draw the 
				distinction between Git and Github. </ls> 
		<ls> How much fun working on a small project like this can be! </ls>
	</ul>
